            I am a curious person that is always trying to learn new things and new hobbies.
            I am multi-lingual and speak 2 languages fluently (English and Spanish) and plan on learning more French, Italian, and Portuguese.
            In the past year, I have traveled abroad, gotten certified in scuba diving, and learned how to knit.
            In addition, I plan on learning how to code, and in the future, I plan on building websites as well as translating them.
            I hope you enjoyed reading my about me section.
